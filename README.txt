Based on the popular theme storefront in WordPress.

== Description ==

Storefront is the perfect theme for your next WooCommerce project. Designed and developed by WooCommerce Core developers, it features a bespoke integration with WooCommerce itself plus many of the most popular customer facing WooCommerce extensions. There are several layout & color options to personalize your shop, multiple widget regions, a responsive design and much more. Developers will love its lean and extensible codebase making it a joy to customize and extend. Looking for a WooCommerce theme? Look no further!

This Project is for me to slowly reverse engineer the storefront theme and custom it.
